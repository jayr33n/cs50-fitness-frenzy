## Description

This project is an online platform for fitness enthusiasts.  
You can share and edit workouts and contribute to the exercise library.  
It is also possible to view an in-depth description of every exercise including targeted muscles and required
equipment.  
This project is consisted of two main sections:

- A complete rest api on the back-end built with **[Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/)**
  and **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)**.
- A simple web interface on the front-end built with **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)**
  and **[JQuery](https://jquery.com/)**.

Additional files, diagrams and low-level details are present in the **[docs](https://github.com/jayr33n/cs50-fitness-frenzy/tree/main/docs)** folder.
